ADJACENT SELECTOR
Select only the paragraphs that are immediately preceded by 
an <h1>


h1 + p {
    color: red;
}


DIRECT CHILD
Select only the <li>'s that are direct children (or descendants)
of a <div> element.

div . li {
    color: white;
}

For example, in an index.html footer section that contains:

<footer>

    <nav>
        <ul> 
            <li>
                <a href="#home">Home</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

<a href = "#license">Content is available under these license.</a>

</footer>

... So, continuation: we have a nav, an unordered list, 
and a list, within the list element, a link to home.

But notice that the:
<a href = "#license">Content is available under these license.</a>

...is directly under footer, or is a direct descendant or child
of the footer section, thus, a direct descendant selector 
demanding to modify all lists that are d d s will affect that 

guy:

<a href = "#license">Content is available under these license.</a>


********************************************************************

So, to target the anchor tag that is a direct descendant of 
the footer, we use the right angle greater than sign:

footer > a {
    color: black;
}
